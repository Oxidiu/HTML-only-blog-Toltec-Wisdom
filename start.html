      <h1>States of Non-Ordinary Reality and Toltec Wisdom</h1>
      <fieldset>
        <section><h3>What are those?</h3>
          <p>
            What are those you ask? Well, let me tell you. A state of non-ordinary reality is when you alter or enchance your senses and percieve the reality in an unusual way, which it is still reality, but seen from a different perspective. Something like how radio receives different information based on the listening frequency. In the same way, the human can percieve different aspects of the surrounding reality based on his senses modulations and finetuing.

          <h3>Reality through another eyes</h3>
          <p>
            Imagine you try to look at the world trough the eyes of another animal, for example a crow. You would see a completely different reality, for example, a crow is able to see the movement in things that are alive as a light emmanating from them. This way, a crow can tell if something is fully alive or is about to die, because the movement in the later ones has slowed down, and they emmanate less glow.</p>

          <p>
            Also, a dead body which started to rott, is a pleasant sight for a crow because, even though its light has stopped, le little detritivor beings eating the flesh and moving through it, are emanating a different kind of light, each individually. That's why crows stare sometimes hours at a corpse.

          <h3>How to get there?</h3>
          <h4>1. Drugs</h4>
          <p>
            This kind of non-ordinary reality can be induced in many different ways. The most common and widely used way is by consuming different halucinogenic substances, but in a ritualic like manner. For you to achieve an actual sight of reality, there is some knowledge needed, you can not just do drugs like a junkie and expect to get universal wisdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, there is a cactus called Mescalito or Peyote. It has mescaline, a neuroactive chemical which, of course, if changes the chemistry in the brain, also changes the perception, the interpretation of the reality, it fine tunes your sense and you receive another signal, just like in the example with the radio.
          </p>
          <h4>3. Dreaming
          </h4>
          <p>
            Another common way to achieve this kind of states is dreaming. In this way you could potentially travel trough other dimmensions, because you can detach your spirit and percieve the reality through the eys of the spirit whigh has nothing to do with the light.</p>
          <h4>4. From a Toltec Man of Knowledge</h4>
          <p>
            Another less common way to achieve this is to receive the wisdom directly from a toltec sorcerer. Yes, you read right, they still exist, but are hard to find. They are normal people like us, but has the toltec wisdom.

          <h3>What Can You Find There?</h3>
          <h4>Inorganic beings</h4>
          <p>
            Toltec sorcerers actually used dreaming to get universal wisdom in the first place. This way, they encountered the inorganic beings. Those beings taught them everything they knew. Taught them the magic, and how to use it in the waking life. They also taught them about Mescalito and any other spirit they could contact and the ways to do it. This also answer the question, how did the native americans knew exactly which plants to use and in which manner to prepare them properly to get the Ayahuaska brew which is widely known nowadays as the core of the most insightful shamanic ritual.
          </p>
          <h4>
          <h4>Mescalito the Teacher</h4>
          <p>
            I was previously talking about the Peyote ritual.In this state, if done in a proper way, you might be lucky enough to meet Mescalito, an inter dimmensional being which is a formless entity, so you can not just see him like you see everything in the waking life. Though, in your visions, for a better perception, your brain will try to interpret him in a way or another and it takes form, it is different from people to people, but most of the people described him as a greenish humanoid with cactine features and wide eyes which bear cosmos images.
          </p>
            Mescalito was said to be a teacher in the toltec wisdom because it taught many things to the ancient toltec sorcerers.
          
  
          </h4>
          <h4>DMT Elves</h4>
          <p>
            The DMT elves usualy appear in people's DMT trips. They are interdimmensional beings that can not be percieved by the naked eye. While tripping on DMT, one sees with the spirit and is able to interact with them.Many people reported that the elves were intrigued by them and were astonished that they could see them and taught them various elves arts, like magic.</p>
